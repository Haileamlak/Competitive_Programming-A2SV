# Problem: Guess Number Higher or Lower  - https://leetcode.com/problems/guess-number-higher-or-lower/

# The guess API is already defined for you.
# @param num, your guess
# @return -1 if num is higher than the picked number
#          1 if num is lower than the picked number
#          otherwise return 0
# def guess(num: int) -> int:

class Solution:
    def guessNumber(self, n: int) -> int:
        left, right = 1, n
        
        while left <= right:
            mid = left + (right - left) // 2
            x = guess(mid)
            if x == -1:
                right = mid - 1
            elif x == 1:
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                return mid
