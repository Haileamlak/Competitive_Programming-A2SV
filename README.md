# Algorithmic Problem Solutions

This repository contains solutions to various algorithmic problems from Leetcode and Codeforces. These solutions were written as part of my journey to master data structures, algorithms, and competitive programming through the A2SV (Africa to Silicon Valley) program.

## About A2SV

[A2SV](https://a2sv.org) - Africa to Silicon Valley is a nonprofit social enterprise that empowers talented young software engineers to create digital solutions to Africa’s most pressing problems. 

The program upskills high-potential university students, connects them with internship opportunities at some of the world's top tech companies, and enables them to address urgent issues in their home countries through digital innovation. The program is free, ensuring that talented youth who lack financial means can still access this opportunity.

A2SV’s rigorous training program prepares students for internships with companies like Google, Palantir, and Coinbase. These internships provide the experience needed to design and build products that improve the quality of life in Africa. Notably, the first cohort of A2SV students achieved a 54% success rate at Google internship interviews for summer 2021.
